**Web Traffic Click-Through Rate (CTR) Analysis.**

**Overview**
This project analyzes web traffic data collected over a 7-day period, with the primary focus on Click-Through Rate (CTR) and pageview events. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project aims to uncover insights into the performance of different links and explore strategies to optimize the CTR.

**Objectives:**
Total and Daily Pageview Events: Determine the total number of pageviews and analyze daily trends.
Analysis of Other Events: Understand the distribution and count of other event types such as clicks.
Geographical Distribution: Investigate the countries contributing to pageviews.
CTR Analysis: Calculate overall CTR and analyze its variation across different links.
Correlation Analysis: Explore potential relationships between clicks and pageviews to determine if there is a statistically significant correlation.

**Dataset:**
The dataset traffic.csv contains the following key columns:

event: Type of event (pageview, click, etc.)
linkid: Unique identifier for the web page link.
isrc: Page content source identifier.
date: Timestamp for the event.
country: Geographic origin of the traffic.


**Key Findings:**
Overall CTR: We calculated the overall Click-Through Rate (CTR) across all web pages.
CTR Distribution: Analyzed how CTR varies across different links, identifying links with high and low conversion rates.
Geographical Insights: Discovered which countries contribute the most to the traffic.
Correlation Analysis: Found correlations between clicks and pageviews, applying statistical tests to validate the significance.
Requirements


To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy


**Instructions for Analysis:**
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset.
Pageview and Click Analysis: Filter events based on their types to separate pageviews and clicks.
CTR Calculation: Calculate the overall CTR and per-link CTR by dividing the number of clicks by pageviews.
Statistical Analysis: Perform correlation analysis to examine the relationship between clicks and pageviews.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate histograms, box plots, and time-series plots to visualize CTR trends.

**Code Example:**
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('traffic.csv')

# Filter pageviews and clicks
pageviews = data[data['event'] == 'pageview']
clicks = data[data['event'] == 'click']

# Calculate overall CTR
total_pageviews = pageviews.shape[0]
total_clicks = clicks.shape[0]
overall_ctr = total_clicks / total_pageviews
print(f"Overall CTR: {overall_ctr:.4f}")


**Visualizations:**
The analysis includes several key visualizations:

CTR Distribution: Histogram and box plot showing the distribution of CTR across links.
CTR Over Time: Time-series plot of daily CTR trends.
Geographical Distribution: Bar chart of pageviews by country.
Conclusion
This project provides insights into how CTR varies across different links and geographic regions. The correlation analysis offers valuable information about the relationship between clicks and pageviews, which can guide future strategies for improving web traffic performance.

Next Steps
CTR Optimization: Explore machine learning techniques to predict high-performing links.
Deeper Geographical Analysis: Investigate specific regional trends and their impact on CTR.
